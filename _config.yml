  Hi, I'm Al-Khadeem Ahmad! I hold a Bachelor of Sciece in Degree in Applied Physics, and have more than 3 years of working experience in data analytics. I've always wanted
  to do data analysis because I'm fond of solving simple and complex problems. 
  <br><br>
  I have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as data mining, dashboard building, and insights generation. My main expertise lies on marketing analytics, with
  proficiency in Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and Looker Studio.
